# my-notes

a minimalist text editor. everything is compressed into the url hash.

- works 100% offline.
- searchable local library.
- syntax highlighting & latex math.
- wiki-style links (`[[note]]`).
- paste images & toggle tasks.
- zero tracking. no database. no account.

### how it works
your text is compressed into the link. copy the url to save or share. if you want it to feel like an app, just add it to your home screen.

### pro tips
- **render**: hit the render button to see code blocks, math, and links.
- **vibe**: cycle themes (midnight, sepia, dark) to match your mood.
- **library**: save notes to your sidebar to build a second brain.
- **tasks**: type `[ ]` for checkboxes. you can tap them to toggle.
- **images**: paste any image from your clipboard directly into the note.
