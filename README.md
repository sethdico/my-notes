# my-notes

a simple text editor in your browser. everything is stored in the url hash.

- works offline.
- word and character count.
- share via link or qr code.
- everything is client-side. no database, no tracking.

### how it works
your text gets compressed into the link. you can copy the url to save or share the note. if you want it on your phone, just add it to your home screen.
